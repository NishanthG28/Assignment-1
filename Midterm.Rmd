Naive: Uses the last observed value as the forecast; useful as a simple benchmark.
SES: Applies exponential smoothing, best for data without trend or seasonality; it’s responsive to recent changes.
Holt-Winters (HW): Adapts to level, trend, and seasonality, ideal for series with predictable seasonal patterns.
Best and Worst by Accuracy
